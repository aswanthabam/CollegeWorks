1) Define a class Poly with private member variables array and size, and public member functions read(), max(), add(), and printPoly().
2) Inside the read() function,
    Prompt the user to input the degree of the polynomial.
    Use a loop to input the coefficient of each term of the polynomial and store it in the array.
3) Inside the max() function
    take two integer parameters and return the maximum value of the two.
4) Inside the add() function,
    Take a pointer to another Poly object as a parameter.
    Create a new Poly object to store the sum.
    Determine the size of the result polynomial as the maximum of the sizes of the two polynomials.
    Copy the coefficients of the first input polynomial into the array of the result polynomial.
    Iterate over the coefficients of the second input polynomial, and add each coefficient to the corresponding coefficient in the array of the result polynomial.
    Return the new Poly object containing the sum.
5) Inside the printPoly method, iterate over each element in the array and print the coefficient and the power of x in the correct format.
6) In the main() 
    Declare two Poly objects poly1 and poly2.
    Call the read() function for each of them to input the polynomial coefficients.
    Call the printPoly() function for each polynomial to display them to the user.
    Call the add() function of poly1 with poly2 as the argument, which returns a pointer to a new Poly object containing the sum of the two polynomials. Store this pointer in a pointer variable res.
    Call the printPoly() function for the result polynomial pointed to by res to display the sum of the two polynomials to the user.
