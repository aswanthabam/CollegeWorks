Start
Define a class called InsertionSort with a public method called sort that takes an array of integers, its size, and two integer references for comparisons and exchanges as parameters.
Set the comparison and exchange variables to zero.
For each element in the array starting from the second element:
Set the key variable to the current element.
Set j to the index of the previous element.
While j is not negative and the element at j is greater than the key:
Set the element at j+1 to the element at j.
Decrement j.
Increment the comparison and exchange variables.
Set the element at j+1 to the key.
Increment the exchange variable.
In the main function:
Prompt the user to enter the size of the array and read the value.
Create an integer array of size equal to the entered value.
Prompt the user to enter the elements of the array and read them.
Create an object of the InsertionSort class called obj.
Declare two integer variables called comparisons and exchanges.
Call the sort method of the obj object, passing the array, its size, and the comparisons and exchanges variables as parameters.
Print the sorted array.
Print the number of comparisons and exchanges made during the sorting process.
End
