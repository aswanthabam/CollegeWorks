Start
Declare a class named "SelectionSort" with a public function "sort" that takes four parameters: an integer array "arr" to be sorted, the size of the array "size", and two integer references "comparisons" and "exchanges".
Initialize "comparisons" and "exchanges" to 0.
Use two nested loops to iterate over the array elements and perform the following operations: 
Compare the current element with the minimum element found so far.
If the current element is smaller than the minimum element found so far, update the index of the minimum element.
If the index of the minimum element found is different than the current element's index, swap the current element with the minimum element found so far.
Increment "comparisons" by 1 for each comparison performed during the inner loop.
Increment "exchanges" by 1 for each swap performed during the outer loop.
After the outer loop completes, the array will be sorted in ascending order.
In the main function, prompt the user to enter the size of the array and the elements of the array.
Create an instance of the SelectionSort class and call the "sort" function using the instance of the SelectionSort class, the array "arr", and the references "comparisons" and "exchanges".
Print the sorted array, number of comparisons, and number of exchanges.
End
